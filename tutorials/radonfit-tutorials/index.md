# Membrane Subtraction Workflow Using Radonfit

## Introduction

This method primarily uses Radon transform and cross-correlation to fit 2D averages with **simple lines and arcs as models**, obtaining mathematical models that include information such as the membrane center, angle, and curvature. It is suitable for **simpler biological membrane models**, such as viral envelopes.

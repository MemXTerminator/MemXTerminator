# Membrane Subtraction Workflow Using Bezierfit

## Introduction

This method primarily utilizes Bezier curves, integrating Monte Carlo methods and Genetic Algorithm, to fit biological membranes in 2D averages with **more complex and irregular curves as models**. This process results in several control points and their corresponding mathematical model. It is particularly suitable for **more complex models of biological membranes**, such as S-shaped or W-shaped membranes, for example, mitochondrial membranes.
